MADISON CENTRAL DIXIE SOFTBALL
****************************************

Hello and welcome to our website. Natalie Major and Hannah Collins were the creators of Madison Central Dixie Sofballs' website.


Natalie and Hannah have had experiences playing softball at Pope Park. Our client which is the League's President, Rick Shakelford, 
was honored that we offered to make him a website for the Dixie league. He said that they had one years ago but they ended up 
getting rid of it. The Madison Central Dixie Softball League has a Facebook page which I have linked to in the footer. Mr.Shakelford
left all the desgin work up to us. We got with him for teams, schedules, and concessions. We later asked him for a testimony, which is
on the site. Hope you enjoy the website and thanks for your time. :)


Entire Website:
  - Our website is the local Dixie Softball league located in Jackson, Tennessee.
  - The design of our website is from a template, King Meat Master, by ThemeWagon. It started out as a restuarant, but
    Natalie changed it into the new  website you see now.
  - The template lead to our color scheme: red, yellow, black, and white. Red and yellow were chosen because they represent 
    a softball. Madison Central did not have a color scheme which lead us to make it the colors of a softball. Black and 
    white were cordianting colors that brought it all together. 
  - We chosed the 'Rubik' font off of Google Fonts because it was classic font and easy to read.
  - The background we chose was part of the template, but we switched the pictures with actually photos of the fields that 
    Natalie took off of her iPhone.
  - Our template that we chose already came responsive, but as we put different things in there we had to edit and adjust the 
    responsiveness around. It is responsive on MacBooks, desktops, tablets, and phones. 
  - Madison Central Dixie has a logo already, but for the 'Home' button we wanted something different and eye-catching. We created 
    a created a logo on a website that includes a field and a softball with our colors: yellow, red, and white. The Home button is 
    located between 'Concessions' and 'Teams'.
  - The 'Favicon' is their actual logo.
  - Our navbar is stationary which is why we don't have a the pages in our footer.
  - We have a select and hover in our navagation and in our footer we have it linked and underline.
  - On our text, we aligned it left so our viewers would not be confused to where the line start at.


Home: 
  - Our home page is fairly simple but it tells our viewers what our website is about.
  - The background is a picture of Field 1 which is located directly to the right at the gate entrance. 
  - We chose the colors, red and yellow, to represent the colors of a softball.


About:
  - The about page has the header 'About Us' and below it says 'What We Have To Offer'.
  - It includes 3 pictures: a large open area, the playground, and the picnic area.
  - We have descriptions under all of the pictures.
  - We also included a link that connects to the address for viewers who does not know where the park is located at.


Staff:
  - The staff page has a quote that is very popular quote that is used by the Dixie association.
  - It has 3 pictures that include 3 umpires that work there and the League's President.
  - Below the umpire pictures, it give descriptions about what age groups they umpire and what fields that they work at.
  - Under 'Rick Shakelford', it gives a brief description of his job.
  - We used a yellow font color so it'll be easier to read and a text-shadow effect for places that had white areas and made it 
    hard to see clearly.
  - Around the pictures, we included a red box-border so we can keep the softball color scheme.
  - The background photo is Field 2, which is located directly foward from the entrance and located between the playground and 
    the concessions.
